    "### Spectrally Smooth the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have relatively noisy data, a low level of smoothing along the spectral axis can be useful. `bettermoments` allows for two different methods: a convolution with a simple top-hat function, or the use of a [Savitzky-Golay filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky-Golay_filter). For a top-hat convolution, you need only specify `smooth`, which describes the kernel size in the number of channels. For a Savitzky-Golay filter, you must also provide `polyorder` which describes the polynomial order which is used for the fitting. Note that `smooth` must always be larger than `polyorder`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that while a small level of smoothing can help with certain aspects of moment map creation, it also distorts the line profile (for example broadening the line in the case of a simple top-hat convolution). Such systematic effects must be considered when analysing the resulting moment maps.\n",

    "### Threshold Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "A threshold mask, or a 'sigma-clip', is one of the most common approaches to masking used in moment map creation. The `get_threshold_mask` provides several features which will help you optimize your threshold masking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clip` argument takes a tuple of values, `clip=(-3.0, 3.0)` describing the minimum and maximum SNR of the pixels that will be removed (this is very similar to the `excludepix` argument in [CASA's immoments task](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/casa-6.1.0/global-task-list/task_immoments/about), but with values given in units of sigma, the noise, rather than flux units). `clip` also accepts just a single value, and will convert that to a symmetric clip as above, for example `clip=(-2.0, 2.0)` and `clip=2.0` are equivalent. The option to provide a tuple allows the options to have asymmetric clip ranges, for example, `clip=(-np.inf, 3.0)`, to remove all pixels below 3 sigma, including high significance but negative pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been found that threshold masks can lead to large artifacts in the resulting moment map if there are large intensity gradients in low SNR regions of the PPV cube. To combate this, users have the option to first smooth the data (only temporarily to generate the threshold mask) which will allow for more conservative contours in the threshold mask. This can be achived by providing the FWHM of the Gaussian kernel used for this spatial smooth as `smooth_threshold_mask` in number of pixels. Note that because the data is smoothed, the effective RMS will drop and so the RMS is re-estimated interally on the smoothed image.\n",
